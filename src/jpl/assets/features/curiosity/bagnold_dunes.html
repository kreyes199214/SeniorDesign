    driving across the rough, washboard surface of Stimson sandstone, Curiosity reached the edge of the Bagnold Dunes on
    Sol 1174. Extending northeast to southwest, this active dune field features wind-driven dunes whose movement can be
    seen from orbit in MRO’s HiRISE camera. Ever since Curiosity’s landing, the Bagnold dunes have presented a barrier
    between the rover and its goal of the higher slopes of Mt. Sharp. Carefully advancing to the edge of the dune field,
    Curiosity sampled the sand and then continued southwest staying off the edge of the sand. </p>
