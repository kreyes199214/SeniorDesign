    After leaving the Murray Buttes behind, Curiosity skirted a southern extension of the Bagnold Dunes. This dune field was noticeably different from what Curiosity had encountered in the north. The northern dune field was characterized by arc-shaped barchan dunes indicating that the wind typically blows north to south in that area. But in the southern dune field, the dunes were linear in shape. Researchers suspected that these could be seif dunes, which could indicate frequently changing wind direction.
