    <p>Curiosity self-portrait on the Naukluft Plateau – credit NASA/JPL/MSSS</p></div> <p> By Sol 1368, Curiosity had
    driven to the western reaches of the Bagnold Dunes. All along, the Curiosity team had been mindful of the hazards of
    sand, and how Spirit’s mission ended when it became stuck in sand in the Columbia Hills. But now, after a long
    westward drive along the Naukluft Plateau off the north edge of the dunes, a clear path was available for Curiosity
    to ascend the slopes of Mt Sharp to the south. Curiosity turned left and began heading south and up toward the
    Murray Buttes. </p>
