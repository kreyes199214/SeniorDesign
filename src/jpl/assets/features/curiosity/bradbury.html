        <p>Goulburn rock outcrop: conglomerated fluvial sediment at Bradbury Landing</p>
    </div>

    Bradbury Landing is the landing site for the Curiosity rover within Gale Crater. It is named after writer Ray Bradbury and is located
    in Aeolis Palus, a flat plain between Gale Crater's northern rim and central peak. Aeolis Palus lies in what
    appears to be the wash debris of Peace Vallis, an outflow channel flowing down the slope of Gale Crater's rim.
    Shortly after landing, Curiosity found evidence supporting this view in the form of rock outcrops in the
    immediate area composed of conglomerated fluvial sediments, the type of formation that would form in a vigorously
    flowing stream.
