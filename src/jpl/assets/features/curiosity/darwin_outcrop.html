    After leaving Glenelg, Curiosity turned southwest on its long journey to the slopes of Mt. Sharp. Along the way,
    researchers had identified several interesting areas of rock outcrops that would serve as waypoints for scientific
    investigation along the way. The first of these, Darwin Outcrop was visited by Curiosity from sols 392-396.
    The sandstone outcrop contained pebbles rounded and deposited by flowing water. Later, intrusive veins of
    water-related minerals penetrated cracks in the sandstone. Findings at Darwin Outcrop broadened the area
    demonstrated to have been altered by flowing water, and continued to reveal the complex history of water on Mars.
