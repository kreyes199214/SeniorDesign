    Continuing eastward, Curiosity spent over 200 sols in a region known as Glenelg. This area marks a junction of 3
    different terrain types and provided Curiosity with the opportunity to examine bedrock that was being exposed as
    the wind eroded the overlying mudstone. At Glenelg, in a shallow depression known as Yellowknife Bay, Curiosity
    made use of its drill to obtain samples from mudstone sedimentary rock formations that were named John Klein and
    Cumberland. The trip to Glenelg was a significant detour for Curiosity on its journey to Mt. Sharp. But it was
    selected for investigation because previous observations from orbit by the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter and other
    spacecraft indicated that water had played a major role in forming rock deposits here. The detour turned out to be
    worth it. Curiosityâ€™s investigations at Glenelg demonstrated that Gale Crater was indeed the site of a lake in the
    distant past, that water was there at multiple times, and that sometimes the water was flowing and sometimes it was
    still. Mass spectrometry measurements by Curiosity obtained an age of four billion years for a sample of rock that
    had been deposited on the lakebed and showed that it had been uncovered by wind erosion about 80 million years ago.
