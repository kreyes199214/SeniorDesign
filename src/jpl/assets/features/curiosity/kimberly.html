    From sols 581 to sol 630, Curiosity examined a complex area of outcrops named the Kimberly. This formation
    consists of three distinct units. Three peaks mark the topmost unit. Beneath them is a smooth-textured unit.
    Below that is a striated unit. A location named Windjana, on the southeast foot of the southern peak in the
    Kimberly was the site for Curiosityâ€™s next drilling operation.

    As seen from orbit, the Kimberly seemed to offer
    interesting similarities to what was found if the Yellowknife Bay area of Glenelg. Specifically, researchers
    were looking for comparisons with areas of scarp retreat in Yellowknife Bay, where a top layer of mudstone is
    being eroded from the rock beneath. While similar structures were visible at the Kimberly, a key difference was
    that in the Kimberly, Curiosity encountered sandstone rather than mudstone.
