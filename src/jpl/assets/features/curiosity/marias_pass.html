    Leaving the Pahrump Hills and continuing southwest, Curiosity made its way to Marias Pass. This region marks the
    transition between two very different rock units. The Murray formation, which includes the Pahrump Hills is composed
    of mudstone presumably deposited on a lake floor. Above it is the Stimson formation which formed from wind-deposited
    sand. Drilling into Murray formation rock just below Marias Pass on Sol 1060, Opportunity obtained samples of a
    silica mineral called tridymite. This was surprising, since tridymite is formed in association with explosive
    silicic volcanism that is common on Earth, but rare or even unknown on Mars. Its presence may force scientists to
    rethink the volcanic history of Mars. Studying the transition between Murray and Stimson rock layers, researchers
    found that millions to maybe even hundreds of millions of years elapsed between the formation of these two layers.
    Continuing its drive onto the washboard surface of Stimson terrain, Curiosity’s cameras revealed bright halos
    surrounding fractures in the rock. These bright halos were found to be enriched in silica compared to surrounding
    rock. </p>
