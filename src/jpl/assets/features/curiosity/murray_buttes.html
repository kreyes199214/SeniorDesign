    After rounding the western edge of the Bagnold Dudes, Curiosity continued south to the Murray Buttes. The mudstone of the Murray Formation that Curiosity has been traversing tells a story of alternating flooding and drying of the ancient lakebed in Gale Crater. The Murray Buttes tell a story of one of the dry periods in this area. They are composed of layered, cross-bedded sandstone originally deposited by wind as migrating sand dunes. The buttes are spectacular landmarks leading south and up the slope of Mt Sharp. Looking ahead from here, the rover team targeted the hematite-rich Vera Rubin Ridge, a clay-rich unit above that, and a sulfate-rich unit even further up. But while still in the Murray formation, Curiosity continued to drill and sample until a fault in the drill feed mechanism disabled the drill on Sol 1536.
