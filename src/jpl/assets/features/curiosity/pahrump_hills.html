    On sol 753 of its mission, Curiosity arrived at the base of Mt. Sharp. The foothills at the base of the mountain
    here are named the Pahrump Hills. These are part of the Murray formation, which underlies all of the other exposed
    rock layers of Mt Sharp. Researchers expect that this represents the oldest geological unit that Curiosity will
    encounter in its journey. Within the Pahrump Hills, Curiosity drilled at three sites, Confidence Hills (sol 759),
    Mojave (sol 882), and Telegraph Peak (sol 908). At the Mojave site, a preliminary analysis indicated the presence of
    jarosite, which would point to rock forming in more acidic water that was found in previous sites, and further
    illustrate the variety in the history of water on Mars. While at the Pahrump Hills, Curiosity took some time to
    point its cameras up from the rocks below it to observe the comet Siding Spring as it passed closer to Mars than any
    comet has passed to Earth in recorded history. On sol 923, Curiosity left the Pahrump Hills by way of Artistâ€™s Drive Valley,
    continuing its exploration at the base of Mt Sharp. From here, Curiosity will continue to traverse into younger layers of
    sedimentary rock, reading the history of how the environment of Mars and the habitability on Mars changed over time.
