<p>
    With a diameter of 154 km and a central peak 5.5 km tall, Gale Crater was chosen as the landing site for the Mars
    Science Laboratory Curiosity rover. The choice was based on evidence from orbiting spacecraft that indicate
    that the crater may have once contained large amounts of liquid water. The central peak, Mount Sharp, exhibits
    layered rock deposits rich in sedimentary minerals including clays, sulfates, and salts that require water to form.
