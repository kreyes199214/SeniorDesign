    <p>'Rocknest' From Sol 52 Location</p>

    Leaving Bradbury Landing, Curiosity drove east across the plain of Aeolis Palus. Between the roverâ€™s 55th and
    100th sols on Mars (a sol is a Martian day, 24 hours, 39 minutes, and 35.244 seconds), Curiosity stopped in a sand
    pit that became known as the Rocknest. At this location, Curiosity used its scoop and ChemMin X-ray diffraction
    analyzer to perform its first soil analysis on Mars. In these tests, Curiosity found abundant, easily accessible
    water at 1.5 to 3 weight percent.
