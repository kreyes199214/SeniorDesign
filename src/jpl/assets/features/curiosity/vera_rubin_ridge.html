    On Sol 1741, Curiosity was looking across a small patch of sand at the base of Vera Rubin Ridge. From this vantage, Curiosityâ€™s Remote Micro-Imager provided stunning views of fine layering in the face of the ridge. This raised ridge is about 200 meters wide and extends about 6.5 kilometers from northeast to southwest, approximately parallel to the Bagnold Dunes. Observations from orbit using the CRISM spectrometer aboard the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter revealed the ridge to be rich in the mineral hematite. This iron oxide mineral forms in association with water, and close study of this deposit could be very useful in understanding the history of water in Gale Crater. Detailed examination by Curiosity could help determine what chemical processes were involved in the formation of the hematite, providing valuable clues about the environment at the time the deposits formed, and the potential for habitability for life at that time. From this location, the rover team planned to drive Curiosity east along the base of the ridge toward a safe location where the rover could climb onto the ridge.
