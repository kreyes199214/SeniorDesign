    <p>Alba Mons, a shield volcano built of fluid lava flows and ash deposits.</p>

<p>
    Though Olympus Mons is the tallest and most massive of the Martian volcanoes, one other volcano has a greater diameter.
    Alba Mons has a base 1015 x 1150 km (631 x 715 miles) across. The summit stands 6.8 km (4.2 miles) high and is topped
    by a caldera 106 x 138 km (66 x 86 miles) across. It is a shield volcano, apparently built of fluid lava flows and
    ash deposits. Its very broad, low profile makes it harder to distinguish than many of the other volcanoes in the area.
    Located on the northern edge of Tharsis, Alba Mons exhibits very ancient lava flows. Its flanks are notable for
    vast systems of great parallel faults, such as those seen in the Ceraunius Fossae.
