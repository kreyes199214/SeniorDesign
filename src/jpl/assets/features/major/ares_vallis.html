<p>
    One of the great outflow channels on Mars, Ares Vallis drained the area of Margaritifer Chaos into Chryse Planitia
    through a spectacular 1,700 km (1,056 miles) long channel. NASAâ€™s Pathfinder mission with the Sojourner rover
    landed in the region where Ares Vallis emptied into Chryse Planitia, in an area rich in deposits streamlined by
    the flow of water.
