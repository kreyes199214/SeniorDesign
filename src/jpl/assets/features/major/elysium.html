    The second-largest of Marsâ€™ volcanic regions (after Tharsis), Elysium is the site for three of Mars' great shield
    volcanoes. Hecates Tholus has a base 177 x 187 km (110 x 116 miles) across. Its summit stands 4.8 km (3 miles) high
    and is crowned by a caldera 13 km (8 miles) across. Elysium Mons is 375 km (233 miles) across, has a summit 14.1 km
    (8.8 miles) high, and a caldera 14 km (8.7 miles) across. Albor Tholus has a base 157 x 164 km (98 x 102 miles)
    across, has a summit 4.1 km (2.5 miles) high, and a caldera 36 km (22 miles) across. Elysium is also marked by a
    number of systems of large faults including the Cerberus Fossae, Elysium Fossae, and Hephaestus Fossae.
