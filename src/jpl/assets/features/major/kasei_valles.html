<p>
    The Kasei Valles form one of the more spectacular systems of outflow channels on the surface of Mars. Roughly 1,800 km
    (1,118 miles) long and 480 km (300 miles) wide, the system of huge canyons was likely carved by one or more gigantic
    floods. Kasei drained a vast area running north from the vicinity of Valles Marineris and along the eastern edge of
    Tharsis. Kasei Valles emptied into Chryse Planitia from the west.
