</div>

<p>
    This gigantic mountain is the largest volcano yet found in the solar system. The summit stands at an altitude of
    21.1 km (13.1 miles), and is crowned by a complex caldera 72 x 91 km (45 x 57 miles) across. The base of
    the mountain is defined be a steep cliff up to 8 km tall and is 640 km across. However, vast aprons of lava
    flows extend for over 1,000 km (621 miles) from the summit towards the northwest. The volume of the mountain has
    been estimated to be an incredible 2,400,000 cubic km. Olympus Mons is a shield volcano, build of innumerable flows
    of quite fluid lava. Some of the flows on the northwest flank may possibly be as young as 2 million years. Olympus
    Mons formed off the northwest edge of the older Tharsis volcanic plateau.
