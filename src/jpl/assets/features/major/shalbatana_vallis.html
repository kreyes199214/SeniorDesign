<p>
    Shalbatana Vallis is a very prominent outflow channel that runs prominently northeast from the crater Orson Welles,
    covering a distance of about 680 km (422 miles) before emptying into Chryse Chaos. It was carved by one or more
    catastrophic floods of water. Shalbatana Vallis is noted for clear signs of shorelines and delta deposits.
