    Tharsis is a gigantic volcanic plateau that is home to some of the solar systemâ€™s largest volcanoes. These include
    Arsia Mons, Pavonis Mons, and Ascraeus Mons.  Arsia Mons is 435 km (270 miles) in diameter, has a summit 17.7 km
    (11 miles) high, and a summit caldera about 110 km (68 miles) across. Pavonis Mons is 380 km (236 miles) in diameter,
    has a summit 14 km (8.7 miles) high, and a summit caldera 91 km (57 miles) across. Ascraeus Mons is 480 km (298 miles)
    in diameter, but extensive lava aprons extend for a total width of about 870 km (540 miles). Its summit is over 18 km
    (11 miles) high, and the summit caldera is about 63 km (39 miles) across. Also found in the Tharsis region are
    numerous other volcanos which, while smaller, are still giants in terms of Earth volcanoes. All of these are shield
    volcanoes and all are now extinct. The linear arrangement of many of these mountains has been interpreted by some
    researchers as a sign of plate tectonics on Mars. Two even larger volcanoes, Olympus Mons and Alba Mons lie to the
    northwest and north of Tharsis respectively.
