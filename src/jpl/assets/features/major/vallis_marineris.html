    One of the most prominent features on the surface of Mars, Valles Marineris is a gigantic gash in the planet’s crust.
    It is a system of gigantic canyons that stretch well over 4,000 km (2,485 miles), from Noctis Labyrinthus in the
    west to the chaotic terrain above the outflow channels into the Chryse Basin to the east. It dwarfs the Earth’s Grand Canyon;
    if Valles Marineris were placed in the United States, it would stretch all the way between the east and west coasts.
    From the southern rim of Melas Chasma to the northern rim of Ophir Chasma measures nearly 600 km (373 miles) across,
    and has depths reaching about 7 km (4.4 miles). The origin of Valles Marineris is still not fully understood,
    but it was almost certainly not formed by flowing water, as were typical (though much smaller) canyons on Earth.
    Rather, it probably was the result of tectonic faulting, possibly related to the massive Tharsis volcanic region
    to the northwest. Though not originally formed by water, flowing water may have played a role in altering the
    terrain in many parts of this region.
