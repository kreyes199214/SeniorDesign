    <b>NASA Commentary:</b> In The Martian, Schiaparelli is the site for the planned Ares 4 mission. Itâ€™s large flat floor and layered deposits are good arguments for it being a candidate landing site on Mars. NASA and our space agency partners are preparing for an increasingly ambitious program of exploration of Mars. As we do, we will be examining many fascinating potential landing sites. As these candidate sites are identified, they will be added to Mars Trek. NASA is providing the public with data from our spacecraft around Mars so that you can get involved in this endeavor. What sites would you choose? What more can you find? You can use Mars Trek to explore and identify many potential landing sites. Join us in this great adventure!
