    <b>NASA Commentary:</b> As Watney reached the halfway point of the water-carved channel of Mawrth Vallis, he made his closest approach to another feature that gives us a fascinating look at the history of water on Mars. About 177 kilometers to the west lies McLaughlin crater, once the site of an ancient Martian crater lake. Measurements of McLaughlin’s floor, made with the Compact Reconnaissance Imaging Spectrometer for Mars (CRISM) instrument aboard NASA’s Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter, reveal deposits of clay and carbonates that formed in the presence of water. There are certainly signs of other crater lakes that existed on Mars, many of them fed by river valleys. Take a look at Gusev crater, fed by Ma’adim Vallis and the site for the Spirit rover. But McLaughlin crater’s rim lacks channels cutting through it that would have allowed water to flow in from outside. Instead, the lake in McLaughlin crater seems to have been fed from below by groundwater. With a diameter of 92 kilometers and a depth of 2.2 kilometers, McLaughlin is one of the deepest craters on Mars. Its low elevation at the base of the highlands of Arabia Terra above it make it a logical place for upwelling groundwater to accumulate. Signs at McLaughlin that standing water may have persisted on the surface long enough for these deposits to have formed raise interesting questions about it having been a potentially habitable environment. But Mclaughlin crater also gives us clues to the wet underground environment that fed water up into the lake. On Earth, up to half the total mass of living material exists underground at depths extending to 5 kilometers or more. On Mars, water-rich regions beneath the surface may have provided the most habitable environments for possible life. Signs that liquid water may still exist beneath Mars’ surface make this idea particularly interesting. McLaughlin crater’s fascinating stories of surface and subsurface water on Mars led to it being named as a candidate site for detailed exploration by NASA’s Mars 2020 rover.
