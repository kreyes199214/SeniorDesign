    In the story “The Martian”, astronaut Mark Watney’s track across 3,200 kilometers of Mars’ surface covers a great variety of terrain. He starts out at the Ares 3 landing site in Acidalia Planitia. This area is covered in sediments deposited by water long ago. The plains of this area were once inundated by water flowing out many outflow channels draining higher land to the east, west, and south. The Mars Pathfinder mission and its Sojourner rover landed at the mouth of one of these outflow channels, Ares Valles. Another of the channels, Mawrth Valles is an important part of Watney’s path. Mawrth Valles, which long ago drained the highlands of Arabia Terra, provides a clearly navigable route as well as a relatively smooth path for Watney through the rugged highlands. The heavily-cratered Arabia Terra represents some of Mars’ most ancient terrain. Watney’s journey then takes him to Terra Meridiani. In a part of Terra Meridiani to the south of Watney’s path, NASA’s Opportunity rover has been studying an area that seems to have been flooded with water on multiple occasions in the distant past. Continuing on, Watney’s goal is the Ares 4 landing site in Schiaparelli crater, a large impact basin about 460 km in diameter located in the eastern part of Terra Meridiani. Schiaparelli’s features include numerous landforms that have been shaped by both water and wind. Explore this wide area stretching from the Ares 3 to Ares 4 landing sites using Mars Trek’s bookmarks for The Martian, Sojourner, and Opportunity, to gain a deeper understanding of the history of this geologically diverse region and the forces that helped form it.
