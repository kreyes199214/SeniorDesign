    <b>NASA Commentary:</b> The Ares 3 landing site, which lies near the border of Chryse Planitia to the south and Acidalia Planitia to the north, certainly is an interesting choice. The flat, smooth terrain of these plains provides the kind of relatively hazard-free surface favored by mission planners entrusted to land expensive hardware on distant worlds. However, the location, set among features that tell a story of flowing water in the past along with the transport of material from widely-distributed source areas, is fascinating for researchers. Come back to this area and explore it in detail using Mars Trek’s Color Hillshade Layer from the Mars Global Surveyor. Look at the numerous features streamlined by the flow of water just to the south of the Ares 3 site. Also look at the numerous outflow channels that feed down into these low-lying plains. Researchers think that these plains may have been the site of a large lake or even a bay in an ancient Martian ocean. To the east of the Ares 3 site is the outflow channel Mawrth Vallis, which plays a major role in the story. Mars Trek’s bookmarks of major features will help you find and explore Ares Vallis to the south, Shalbatana Vallis to the southwest, and Kasei Vallis to the west. You can use Mars Trek to find numerous other ancient outflow channels that directed water into the area now covered by these plains. The Sojourner rover of the Mars Pathfinder mission (which also plays a major role in the story of the Martian) operated near the mouth of Ares Vallis. Use Mars Trek’s bookmark for the Sojourner Landing Site to explore that area in greater detail. As you explore, you will find ample evidence that although Mars’ surface is a harsh desert today, its environment was very different long ago. Mars’ watery past is key to our interest in this planet. Here on Earth, wherever we find liquid water, even in the boiling pools of Yellowstone Park, or beneath the frozen icecap of Antarctica, or even in the cooling systems of nuclear reactors, we find life. So when we see clear signs that liquid water once flowed across the surface of Mars, we can’t help but wonder if the environment on Mars back then might have supported life. Although the surface of Mars is a forbidding desert now, we can’t help but be intrigued by signs that liquid water may still flow beneath its surface.
