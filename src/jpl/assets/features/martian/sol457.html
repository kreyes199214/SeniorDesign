    <b>NASA Commentary:</b> Watney takes advantage of the smooth, relatively level, easily navigable floor of Mawrth Valles to guide him through part of his journey. Like most outflow channels on Mars, Mawrth Vallis formed during the Noachian to Hesperian periods in Mars’ distant past. Alteration by the flow of water probably ended by 3.7 billion years ago. Sudden, cataclysmic releases of water were probably typical in carving many of these canyons like Mawrth. However, the role of flowing water in the formation of this river valley (and others) may have occurred over a span of hundreds of millions of years. When Watney first enters Mawrth Vallis, the canyon is too wide for him to be able to actually see the walls in either direction. Use Mars Trek’s tools from the menu on the right to measure distances and elevations and to gain an appreciation for the impressive width, length, and depth of this ancient river valley. Then, as big as it is, look at how small it seems compared to some of the other truly giant outflow channels in the area.
