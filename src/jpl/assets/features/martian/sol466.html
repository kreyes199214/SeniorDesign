    <b>NASA Commentary:</b> The highlands of Arabia Terra are especially heavily cratered and provide one of the greater challenges for Watney in his journey. In fact, this area has one of the densest concentrations of craters anywhere on Mars. This tells us something especially interesting about this area. The surface here is very, very old. Over time, the entire surface of Mars has been repeatedly struck by numerous crater-forming asteroids. However some areas of Mars have been resurfaced by lava flows, flowing water, ocean sediments, and even glaciers. When this happens, the craters that were there previously get erased from the area. New craters will form subsequent to the resurfacing, but the total number of craters in the area will be less than in an area that has not experienced such resurfacing. The fewer craters in an area, the more recently its current surface formed. The more craters in an area, the more ancient its surface is. Counting craters is one of the main tools used by planetary scientists in determining the relative ages of different terrains. You can use this technique in Mars Trek to compare the ages of different surfaces all over Mars. Though crater counting is a great technique for figuring out relative ages of different areas, we really need to retrieve actual samples to study in the lab in order to determine absolute ages for these surfaces. Use Mars Trek’s line tool to draw a transect from the low plains near the Ares 3 site up into the highlands of Arabia Terra. Then generate an elevation profile along the line you have drawn. It should become very clear why Ares 3 landed on the plains rather than the highlands! Even though Arabia Terra is a rough area to explore, it is interesting because it preserves some of the oldest land on Mars.
