    <b>NASA Commentary:</b> The craters Trouvelot, Becquerel, and Marth form the points of a triangle that Watney names after himself. Take a look at the area immediately within Watney Triangle. You see no towering volcanoes, no long river canyons, no ancient shorelines. You see an area that actually looks very much like much of the surface of the Moon, a jumbled field of impact craters. This is very similar to the first close-up view of Mars that we got from NASAâ€™s Mariner 4 spacecraft in 1964 as it sent back a few pictures as it sped past Mars. It imaged only a tiny portion of Mars, and as luck would have it, these covered some of the least interesting terrain on Mars. Much the same happened again as Mariners 6 and 7 returned images from their flybys of Mars. The old dream of a dynamic, exotic Mars was replaced by the view of Mars being a dead, crater-covered, Moon-like world. This changed in 1971 when Mariner 9 actually went into orbit around Mars. After a global dust storm cleared, Mariner 9 discovered amazing features including towering volcanoes three times as tall as Mount Everest, and a titanic canyon system that ended up getting named after Mariner 9, Valles Marineris. Since then, subsequent probes continue to reveal that Mars does indeed have a dynamic, exotic surface, a surface that might, just possibly, have once supported life.
