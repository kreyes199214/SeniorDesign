	<b>NASA Commentary:</b> Watney’s journey takes him into Terra Meridiani. Researchers have long found Terra Meridiani to be particularly interesting. Within the area is the plain Planum Meridiani. Prior to Opportunity’s landing there in 2004, measurements from two NASA spacecraft in orbit around Mars, Mars Global Surveyor and Mars Odyssey, determined that the area was rich in the mineral grey hematite. On Earth, this iron oxide mineral typically forms in the presence of liquid water. The strong signature of grey hematite made this area particularly attractive as a location to study the potential for Mars having a wet, watery past. You can explore Opportunity’s area of operation in detail and learn about its discoveries in Terra Meridiani through Mars Trek’s “Opportunity Landing Site” bookmark.
