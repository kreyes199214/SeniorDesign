    <b>NASA Commentary:</b> Watney decides to enter Schiaparelli crater along a relatively gentle slope southwest of a small crater that he names Entrance crater. It is located on the northwest rim of Schiaparelli. Using Mars Trek to zoom in on the rim of Schiaparelli near Entrance crater, you can see that Watney made a reasonable decision. Using Mars Trek’s high resolution-imagery and elevation profile tool will allow you to confirm that other parts of Schiaparelli’s rim are far steeper and more precipitous than the natural ramp Watney decided to use.  However, as Watney learns, even relatively smooth areas are not necessarily safe. NASA’s Spirit rover had its extended mission come to an end when it became stuck in a relatively flat, smooth patch of sand. Navigating across alien terrains is risky business. Hazard analysis is a critical part of choosing a landing site and determining paths for surface operations on other worlds. Special tools that allow mission planners to examine slopes, crater abundances, rock abundances, and more are essential for mission success. Be sure to keep an eye on the scale when comparing Mars Trek elevation graphs. Mars’ terrain has very wide ranges of elevation. (Note: don’t confuse “Entrance crater” with the name “Edom” that shows up nearby. Edom refers to a light patch or albedo feature rather than the crater.)
