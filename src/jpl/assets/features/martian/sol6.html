    <b>NASA Commentary:</b> The dust storm that caused Watney to be stranded on Mars in the story is certainly terrifying. But do such dust storms really exist? Giant dust storms do indeed exist on Mars. They can extend over great heights and distances. When NASA’s Mariner 9 spacecraft entered orbit around Mars in 1971, the entire planet was obscured by a global dust storm! Imagine the disappointment of the mission team members back on Earth as images returned after that long journey to Mars showed only an indistinct haze of dust. Fortunately, the storm eventually cleared, and Mariner 9 was able to return images of many amazing surface features. There is one critical difference between the dust storms on Mars and the storm at the beginning of the story. First, consider the fact that Mars’ atmosphere is much thinner than the Earth’s. It averages about 1% the density of Earth’s. So a wind on Mars would have only 1/100 the mass of a wind with the same velocity on Earth. Remember that kinetic energy of the wind equals one-half of the mass times the square of velocity. That difference in mass, between the Earth and Mars, means that a wind blowing on Mars would deliver only 1/10 the energy of a wind blowing at the same speed on Earth. When those winds at Ares 3 hit a scary sounding 175 km per hour, they would have only felt like a 17.5 km/h (11 mph) breeze here on Earth. Not likely to knock much over. But that doesn’t mean it’s safe to just ignore Martian dust storms. As is told in the story, they can block out light that is critical for solar-powered probes, rovers, and equipment. Dust storms that extend to 20 or 30 km in height can also generate electrical discharges or lightning that could be harmful to robots and astronauts.

    It’s interesting to note that in addition to dust storms, Mars has some pretty interesting dust devils too. Take a look at the area around the Spirit Rover Landing Site in Mars Trek’s bookmarks. See all the dark squiggly lines? Those are the paths of dust devils, areas where the dust on the surface was blown away revealing the darker rock below. On a number of occasions, as Spirit would be driving along, and its power levels slowly dropping from the accumulation of dust on its solar panels getting thicker from the dust the rover was kicking up, a dust devil would blow over the rover, cleaning it off and restoring power levels!
