    <b>NASA Commentary:</b> The Hab is a critical element in the story of the Martian. It provides the astronauts subject to the harsh environment of Mars with a breathable atmosphere, heat, protection from radiation, as well as room in which to live and work. NASA is preparing for this phase of future Mars exploration today. The Human Exploration Research Analog (HERA) at NASA’s Johnson Space Center is a self-contained environment that simulates a deep-space habitat. The two-story habitat is complete with living quarters, workspaces, a hygiene module and a simulated airlock. Within the module, test subjects conduct operational tasks, complete payload objectives and live together for 14 days (soon planned to increase to up to 60 days), simulating future missions in the isolated environment. Astronauts have recently used the facility to simulate ISS missions. These research analogs provide valuable data in human factors, behavioral health and countermeasures to help further NASA’s understanding on how to conduct deep space operations.
