    Opportunity’s aeroshell provided protection for the rover during its seven-month journey to Mars and its entry
    into Mars’ atmosphere, and consisted of two parts, the heat shield and the backshell.
    The heat shield protected the rover and lander from the intense heat of entry into Mars’
    atmosphere, slowing them from 12,000 mph down to 1,000 mph, and was then jettisoned
    shortly after the parachute opened at 30,000 feet. The backshell contained the parachute, a tether for
    lowering the lander and rover, various electronics, and three retrorockets. The rover and lander detached
    from the backshell about three seconds before landing. Opportunity drove to the heat shield’s impact location.
    While it did not visit the backshield or parachute, it did image them from the edge of Eagle Crater.
