<p>
    Opportunity’s journey across Mars’ surface has included stops at several impact craters. These craters expose multiple
    layers of bedrock, allowing Opportunity to read the history recorded in these layers of rock. As luck would have it,
    Opportunity actually landed in a small impact crater. Eagle crater, with a diameter of 22 meters and a depth of 3 meters,
    proved to be an excellent place for Opportunity to start its mission. The crater contains exposed rock outcrops which,
    upon close examination, revealed the source of the grey hematite readings seen from space. In the rock and ground around
    it are numerous small, hematite-rich spherules which the scientists referred to as “blueberries”. The blueberries are
    actually concretions that formed in the presence of water.
