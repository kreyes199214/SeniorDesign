<p>
    A long journey brought Opportunity to the edge of Endeavour Crater. At 22 kilometers in diameter and 300 meters deep,
    it is by far the largest crater that Opportunity will examine. During its exploration along the rim of the crater,
    Opportunity came upon a vein of calcium sulfate, probably in the form of gypsum, protruding up above the surrounding
    rock.

    This vein, named Homestake, probably formed from water dissolving calcium out of volcanic rocks and then
    combined with sulfur either leached from the rock or from volcanic gas. This deposit tells a story of water that
    was far less acidic (and possibly more hospitable to life) than was found in previous locations. Additional sulfate
    veins were encountered as Opportunity continued its journey along the rim toward an area known as Marathon Valley
    which measurements from orbit indicate is rich in phyllosilicate clay minerals, rich in clues to Marsâ€™ watery past.
