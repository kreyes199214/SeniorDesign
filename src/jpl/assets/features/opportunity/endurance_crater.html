    After leaving Eagle crater, scientists at NASAâ€™s Jet Propulsion Laboratory directed Opportunity on a journey that
    took it to Endurance crater (130 meter diameter, 20 meter depth). Upon arrival at the crater, it was obvious
    that the crater exposed layers of stratified rock. A survey conducted from the rim found a safe entry point from
    which to drive Opportunity into the crater. Study of the layers of exposed rock showed the complexity of the history
    of water in this area with the region having apparently been flooded on multiple occasions, with dry periods in
    between. At the floor of Endurance Crater is a field of sand dunes, which the rover team chose to avoid so as to
    minimize the risk of getting the rover stuck. After spending over six months inside Endurance Crater, Opportunity
    exited safely and continued its journey across Meridiani Planum.
