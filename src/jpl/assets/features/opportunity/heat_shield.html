    After leaving Endurance Crater, the rover team directed Opportunity to the site of the impact of its heat shield.
    Engineers were excited about the chance to examine the shield to evaluate its performance in protecting Opportunity
    from the roughly 1,000-degree Celsius temperatures as it entered Marsâ€™ atmosphere.

    This task was found to be more challenging than initially thought when Opportunity found the shield, broken into two main pieces, had inverted, or
    turned itself inside out upon impact with the ground.In a fascinating coincidence, a basketball-sized nickel-iron
    meteorite was found to be lying on the surface next to the heat shield. This was the first meteorite to be found on
    another planet. Opportunity spent 36 sols (Martian days) at this site.
