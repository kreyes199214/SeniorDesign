    While traversing north along the Cape York area of Endeavour Craterâ€™s rim, Opportunity came upon a vein of calcium
    sulfate, probably in the form of gypsum, protruding up above the surrounding rock. This vein, named Homestake,
    probably formed from water dissolving calcium out of volcanic rocks and then combined with sulfur either leached
    from the rock or from volcanic gas. This deposit tells a story of water that was far less acidic (and possibly more
    hospitable to life) than was found in previous locations. Additional sulfate veins were encountered as Opportunity
    continued its journey along the rim toward Marathon Valley. </p>
