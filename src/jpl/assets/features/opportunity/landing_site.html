    Opportunity’s journey across Mars’ surface has included stops at several impact craters. These craters expose
    multiple layers of bedrock, allowing Opportunity to read the history recorded in these layers of rock.
    As luck would have it, Opportunity actually landed in a small impact crater. Eagle crater, with a diameter of
    22 meters and a depth of 3 meters, proved to be an excellent place for Opportunity to start its mission. The
    crater contains exposed rock outcrops which, upon close examination, revealed the source of the grey hematite
    readings seen from space.

    In the rock and ground around it are numerous small, hematite-rich spherules which the
    scientists referred to as “blueberries”. The blueberries are actually concretions that formed in the presence of water.
