    Valley cuts through the western rim of Endeavor Crater. It attracted the interest of researchers because data from
    the Compact Reconnaissance Imaging Spectrometer for Mars (CRISM) onboard the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter (MRO)
    indicated that tis area should be rich in smectite clay minerals that had formed in the presence of water.
    Researchers thought they might find rich clay deposits there similar to those they found around Matijevic Hill.
    Instead, they found that the iron-rich clay is mixed throughout the area with bedrock that was broken and ejected in
    the impact that formed Endeavour. Deep red bands crossing the valley indicated fractures where water may have
    flowed, altered existing rock, and deposited soluble minerals. Examination of these bands did not reveal smectites,
    but did find magnesium sulfate, something researchers would expect to find precipitating from water. After exploring
    Marathon Valley, Opportunity exited back out the western opening of the valley and continued south in its
    exploration of Endeavour Crater. </p>
