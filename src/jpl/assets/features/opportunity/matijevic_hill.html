    south along the eastern slopes of Cape York on Endeavor Crater’s west rim, Opportunity circled and explored a
    feature that would become known as Matijevic Hill. Data from the Compact Reconnaissance Imaging Spectrometer for
    Mars (CRISM) onboard the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter (MRO) indicated that tis area should be rich in smectite clay
    minerals that had formed in the presence of water. In a rock unit they called Whitewater Lake at Matijevic Hill,
    Opportunity came upon rich deposits of smectite clays including nontronites and montmorillonite, providing new
    evidence of a time on Mars when water flowed and life might possibly have emerged. Matijevic Hill was named for Jake
    Matijevic, one of the original members of the MER design team and former chief of MER engineering. </p>
