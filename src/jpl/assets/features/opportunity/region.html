    <p>Meridiani Planum</p>

<p>
    For mission planners looking to land a robot rover on Mars, Meridiani Planum looked very inviting. Its wide flat,
    open terrain offered excellent chances for a safe landing. For scientists looking to explore the past history of
    liquid water on Mars, Meridiani Planum was especially interesting too. Observations from orbit indicated that
    this area was rich in the mineral grey hematite, which is often formed in the presence of water.
