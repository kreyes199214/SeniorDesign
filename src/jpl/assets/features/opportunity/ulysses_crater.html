    <p>Comet Siding Spring as imaged by Opportunity â€“ credit NASA/JPL-Caltech/Cornell Univ./ASU/TAMU</p></div> <p> After
    leaving the Cape York area, Odyssey headed south along the west rim of Endeavour Crater toward Marathon Valley.
    Along the way, it stopped to examine a small crater named Ulysses Crater and the blanket of pulverized rock ejected
    around it. From here, on Sol 3817 of its mission (Oct. 21, 2014), Odyssey used its Panoramic Camera to image Comet
    Siding Spring, which passed only 139,500 kilometers from Mars, far closer than any previous recorded flyby of a
    comet past Mars or the Earth. </p>
