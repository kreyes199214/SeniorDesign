<p>
    At 750 meters in diameter and 70 meters in depth, Victoria Crater is significantly larger than either Eagle or
    Endurance craters. When Opportunity arrived at the crater, it drove about a quarter of the way around the rim,
    mapping the crater and looking for a safe route in. Again, numerous layers of sedimentary rock were exposed
    and a large dune field occupied the floor of the crater. Inside the crater, analysis of the exposed rock showed
    that the processes that had been at work locally in Eagle and Endurance craters acted more widely, on a regional scale.
    Sulfate salts were produced by the interaction between basalt rock and acidic water. Sand generated, transported,
    and deposited by the wind became cemented into sedimentary rock under the influence of groundwater. Differences
    between layers told how the processes of sedimentary rock formation changed as Mars became more arid. Opportunity
    spent 341 sols (Martian days) exploring inside Victoria Crater before exiting and continuing on.
