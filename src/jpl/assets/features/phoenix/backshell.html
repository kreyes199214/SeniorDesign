    Phoenix’s aeroshell provided protection for the rover during its seven-month journey to Mars and its entry into
    Mars’ atmosphere, and consisted of two parts, the heat shield and the backshell. The backshell contained the parachute,
    and a wraparound antenna to transmit an ultra-high frequency signal to Earth via NASA’s Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter (MRO)
    or Mars Odyssey spacecraft. At an altitude of 1 km (3,200 ft) and still falling at 200 kph (125 mph) Phoenix separated
    from the backshell, freefalling for about half a second before firing its rockets for its final descent to the surface.
