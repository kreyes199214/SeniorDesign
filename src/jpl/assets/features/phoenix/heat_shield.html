    Phoenix’s aeroshell provided protection for the rover during its seven-month journey to Mars and its entry
    into Mars’ atmosphere, and consisted of two parts, the heat shield and the backshell.
    The heat shield protected the lander from the intense 1,400° C (2,600° F) heat of entry into Mars’ atmosphere,
    slowing it from 21,000 kph (13,000 mph) down to 1,400 kph (900 mph). At that point, at an altitude of 12.6 km
    (7.8 miles), the parachute was designed to open and, shortly afterward, the head shield was jettisoned.
