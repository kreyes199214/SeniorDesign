    The Phoenix lander’s objectives were to study the history of water on Mars in all its phases, and to search for
    evidence of a habitable zone and assess the biological potential of the ice-soil boundary. The presence of this
    ice was confirmed when it was exposed in a trench dug by Phoenix’s robotic arm. Findings of soil analysis from
    the area revealed the presence of carbonates as well as perchlorate.  Phoenix also observed snow falling from
    clouds above it. Designed to operate for three months, Phoenix lasted for five months before succumbing to the
    diminishing light of the approaching winter. The advancing winter ice cap covered the area, with later images
    from orbit the showing the remains of the spacecraft after the ice had retreated.
