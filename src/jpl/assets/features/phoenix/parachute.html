    Phoenix’s parachute, contained in the backshell, was designed to be deployed after the heat shield had slowed
    Phoenix to 1,400 kph (900 mph), at an altitude of 12.6 km (7.8 miles). The deployment of the parachute occurred
    about seven seconds later than planned, but Phoenix landed successfully within the targeted area. Phoenix rode the
    parachute down to an altitude of 1 km (3,200 ft) and a velocity of 200 kph (125 mph) before separating from the
    backshell, and making the final descent using its rocket engines. Phoenix’s descent by parachute was captured
    from orbit by the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter.
