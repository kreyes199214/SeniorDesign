    On May 25, 2008, NASA’s Phoenix probe touched down in Mars’ northern plains known as Vastitas Borealis. Phoenix’s
    descent by parachute was captured from orbit by MRO. The landing site, given the unofficial name of Green Valley,
    was chosen for its smooth, boulder-free terrain and suitability for fulfilling Phoenix’s objectives. The presence
    of sub-surface ice in this area was suggested by polygonal features several meters across and roughly 10-50
    centimeters high that cover the terrain here. On Earth, similar features are formed by the alternate freezing
    and thawing of sub-surface ice.
