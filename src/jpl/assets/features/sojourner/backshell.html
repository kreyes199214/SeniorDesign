    <p>Pathfinder's aeroshell with its three retrorockets firing.</p>

<p>
    Pathfinder’s aeroshell provided protection for the lander and rover during its seven-month journey to Mars and
    its entry into Mar’s atmosphere, and consisted of two parts, the heat shield and the backshell. The backshell
    contained the parachute, a tether for lowering the lander and rover, various electronics, and three retrorockets.
    Once the heat shield had slowed Pathfinder to about 1,300 kph (830 mph), the backshell jettisoned the heat shield,
    deployed the parachute and lowered Pathfinder down the 20-meter tether. At an altitude of 98 meters, the backshell
    fired its retrorockets, slowing Pathfinder to a velocity of 0 at an altitude of 21.5 meters. The rover and lander
    then detached from the backshell falling to the ground. This successful entry, descent, and landing strategy became
    the model for the future MSL rovers.
