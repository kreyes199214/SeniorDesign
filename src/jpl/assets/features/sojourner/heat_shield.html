    Pathfinder’s aeroshell provided protection for the lander and rover during its seven-month journey to Mars
    and its entry into Mar’s atmosphere, and consisted of two parts, the heat shield and the backshell.
    The heat shield protected the rover and lander from the intense heat of entry into Mars' atmosphere, slowing them
    from 22,000 kph (13,600 mph) down to about 1,300 kph (830 mph), and was then jettisoned shortly after the
    parachute opened.
