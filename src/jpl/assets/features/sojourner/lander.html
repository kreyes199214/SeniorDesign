    During descent and at an altitude of 355 meters, a cluster of airbags was inflated, surrounding and protecting
    the lander. At an altitude of 21.5 meters, the lander separated from the backshell, falling and then bouncing
    in its encasing balloons to a rest on the ground, where the balloons were deflated. This successful entry, descent,
    and landing strategy became the model for the future MSL rovers. The lander opened it petals revealing solar panels
    and the Sojourner rover. The lander conducted imaging and meteorology studies, and acted as a communications relay
    for the Sojourner rover. NASA honored the legacy of Dr. Carl Sagan by renaming the lander the Carl Sagan Memorial Station.
