    After the heat shield had slowed Pathfinder to about 1,300 kph (830 mph), the backshield deployed the parachute,
    which slowed Pathfinder to a velocity of 245 kph (153 mph). Pathfinder rode the parachute down to an altitude of
    98 meters at which point the backshellâ€™s retrorockets were fired.
