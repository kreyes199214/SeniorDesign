<p>
    On July 4, 1997, NASA’s Mars Pathfinder mission, carrying the Sojourner rover, touched down in Ares Vallis.
    This area is a large outflow channel where in the distant past, flowing water carved dramatic erosional features.
    The Pathfinder mission touched down near the mouth of the channel, where smooth terrain offered safe opportunities
    for landing. The channel flows northwest from Margaritifer Terra and may have once fed a series of lakes near Mars’ equator.
