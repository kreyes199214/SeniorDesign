<p>
    The first robotic rover to drive on the surface of Mars, Sojournerâ€™s instrumentation included three cameras and
    an Alpha Proton X-ray Spectrometer (APXS) to measure composition of Martian rocks and dust. Designed for a mission
    lasting 7 sols (Martian days or 24 hours, 39 minutes, and 35.244 seconds), but actually continued operating for 83
    sols, until a battery in the lander finally was exhausted. During that time, it covered a distance of 100 meters
    around its landing site.
