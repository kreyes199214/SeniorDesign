    After departing from its landing site, Spirit drove along the rims of Bonneville crater (200 meter diameter, 10 meter
    depth), Missoula crater (91 meter diameter, 18 meter depth) and Lahontan crater (55 meter diameter, 9 meter depth)
    as it drove along the floor of Gusev crater. During this initial stage of its journey, Spirit found no signs of lake
    deposits. Instead, the ground was covered in basaltic lava rock that showed only slight signs of alteration by very
    small amounts of water. If a lake floor had been there, it had been covered by later deposits of volcanic rock.
