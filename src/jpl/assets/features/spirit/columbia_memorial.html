<p>
    One of two robotic rovers in NASA's Mars Exploration Rover program, Spirit was designed to explore the
    geology of Mars, look for evidence for the presence of liquid water on Mars' surface in the past, look for
    geological clues to the environmental conditions that existed when liquid water was present, and assess
    whether those environments were conducive to life. Spirit's landing site was named Columbia Memorial Station in
    honor of the seven astronauts killed in the Space Shuttle Columbia disaster.
