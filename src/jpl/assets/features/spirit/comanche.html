    <p>Comanche Outcrop on Mars indicates hospitable past</p>
</div>

<p>
    In March, 2005, while driving downhill from its exploration of Husband Hill and McCool Hill,
    Spirit came upon a rock outcrop scientists named Comanche. Analysis of Comanche with Spiritâ€™s spectrometers showed
    Comanche to be very carbonate rich. Carbonates form in the presence of water, and the water they form in cannot be
    very acidic. Later analysis of data from Spirit by a team led by Steve Ruff at Arizona State indicated that this
    carbonate formed in low temperature surface water, consistent with a lake in Gusev crater.
