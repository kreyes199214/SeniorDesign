    Within the Columbia Hills, Home Plate is a plateau about 90 meters across. It was picked out from orbit as a high
    priority target for Spirit to explore. Analysis using the instruments aboard Spirit indicated that Home Plate may
    have been formed from deposits resulting from a hydrovalcanic explosion. Basaltic magma rising through the rock may
    have encountered subsurface briny water. The heat of the magma turned the water into high-pressure steam, resulting
    in an explosive eruption.
