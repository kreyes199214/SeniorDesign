    Perhaps the best vantage point for Spirit to survey the terrain it was exploring came when it climbed to the top of
    Husband Hill, the tallest of the Columbia Hills. Not only did Husband Hill provide an expansive vista, it also
    provided some excellent rock outcrops to study. The Cumberland Ridge on Husband Hill was examined in detail by Spirit.
    The presence of the mineral goethite here showed that water had been involved in the formation of these rocks.
    Rock here was also found to have a higher concentration of phosphorus than had been seen anywhere on Mars before.
    One possibility explaining the high phosphorous levels could be phosphate deposited by water.
