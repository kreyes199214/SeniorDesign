        <p>A rock that researchers named "Pot of Gold"</p>

    NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory directed Spirit toward the Columbia Hills, a range of low hills on the floor of
    Gusev crater, about 3 kilometers from Spirit's landing site. These hills are composed of older material rising above
    the volcanic debris surrounding it. As Spirit climbed into the hills, the mineralogy around it changed. A rock that
    researchers named "Pot of Gold" was found to contain the mineral hematite, which often forms in the presence of
    water.
    The amount of olivine in rocks around Spirit declined as the amount of sulfates went up, and increasing

    concentrations of phosphorus, sulfur, chlorine, and bromine were measured - all consistent with the rocks having
    been in the presence of water. Discovery of the mineral Goethite was important, since it forms only in the presence
    of water.
