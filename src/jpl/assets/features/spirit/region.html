    <p>Gusev crater and Ma'adim Vallis</p>
</div>

<p>
    Gusev crater is a spectacular place. Located in Mars' southern hemisphere, the crater measures 166 kilometers across
    and was formed by a large meteoroid impact 3 to 4 billion years ago. One of Gusev's most interesting features is a
    large breach in the southern rim of the crater. This breach is the northern end of Ma'adim Vallis, one of Mars'
    largest channels carved by flowing water.

    The magnificent canyon of Ma'adim Vallis stretches for about 700 kilometers south from Gusev crater. Its wider
    sections measure over 20 kilometers across and it reaches 2 kilometers in depth. This makes it significantly
    larger than Earth's Grand Canyon. Ma'adim Vallis seems to have drained a large area of lakes to the south when,
    in Mars' distant past, water was abundant on its surface.  The water from those lakes apparently flowed through
    Ma'adim and into Gusev crater. Observations from satellites orbiting Mars provided scientists with evidence that
    Gusev may have once been a giant crater lake. The floor of the crater may have been covered by thick layers of
    lake sediments. Where Ma'adim Vallis enters Gusev crater, the floor of Gusev is covered in structures that resemble
    river delta deposits.

    The terrain to the north of Gusev crater is quite interesting too. The volcano Apollinaris Patera towers into the
    sky. Its summit reaches about 5 kilometers high and its base measures 296 kilometers across. At its top, a giant
    volcanic caldera measures about 80 kilometers in diameter.
