        <p>Bright white silica-rich material revealed from a stuck rover wheel.</p>
    </div>

    While driving in the Columbia Hills in March, 2006, the front right of Spiritâ€™s 6 wheels stopped turning.
    Turning around and dragging the stuck wheel behind it resulted in a fascinating discovery. At one point, the stuck
    wheel scraped away the dark surface soil revealing bright white silica-rich material below. This material formed
    either in a hot spring or steam fumarole, either of which might possibly have provided an environment suited for
    microbial life.
