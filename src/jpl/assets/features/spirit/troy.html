    On May 1, 2009, Spirit became stuck in soft soil at the western edge of Home Plate. The ground team tried
    repeatedly to free the rover from its trap, but on January 26, 2010, NASA declared that Spirit was now a stationary
    research station. During previous Martian winters, Spirit was able to park on sunward-facing slopes to maximize power
    to its solar cells in order to survive the winter. But now that it  was stationary, it was no longer able to perform
    this tactic. The final communication with Spirit occurred on March 22, 2010. During its lifetime, it traveled more than
    7.7 kilometers across the Martian surface. It functioned for 2,210 Martian days, far beyond its original primary mission
    of 90 Martian days (a Martian day lasts for 24 hours, 39 minutes, and 35.244 seconds). During this time, Spirit returned
    fascinating clues to Marsâ€™ watery past.
