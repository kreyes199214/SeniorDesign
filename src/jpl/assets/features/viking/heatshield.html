Viking’s aeroshell provided protection for the lander during its entry into Mars’ atmosphere. The aeroshell consisted of two parts, the backshell and the heat shield. The heat shield protected the lander from the intense heat of entry into Mars’ atmosphere and provided frictional braking. After the parachute was deployed from the backshell at a height of 6,400 meters, the heat shield was discarded, falling to the ground. The heat shield’s final location northeast of the lander was identified years later when it was imaged by the high-resolution HiRISE camera aboard the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter.
