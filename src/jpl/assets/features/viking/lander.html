The three-legged, 450 kilogram lander featured communications antennae, two scanning cameras, a seismometer, and a mast supporting meteorology instruments. A robotic arm included a sample scoop, a temperature sensor, a magnet, and mirrors to provide views of otherwise inaccessible areas. Viking biology experiments included the Pyrolytic Release experiment, the Labeled Release experiment, and the Gas Exchange experiment. A gas chromatograph/mass spectrometer measured the composition and abundance of organic compounds in the Martian soil and the composition of the Martian atmosphere.  An x-ray fluorescence spectrometer was used for inorganic chemistry analysis. The lander was also equipped with computer, power, data, and thermal control systems. Power was supplied by radioisotope thermoelectric generators. After descending to 1,200 meters on its parachute, the lander jettisoned the parachute, extended its 3 legs, and made the final descent to the surface using its terminal descent thrusters which fired for 40 seconds to slow the final velocity to 2 meters per second. The nearly featureless terrain of the landing site prevented pinpointing the lander’s location by comparing ground-based images from the lander with images from orbiters. Its precise location was only able to be determined years later when the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter’s HiRISE camera was actually able to image the Viking 2 lander on the surface.
