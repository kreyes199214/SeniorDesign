    The Viking orbiters found Chryse Planitia to have abundant signs of water flowing across it in Mars’ distant past. Numerous large water outflow channels emptied into Chryse, including Kasei Valles, Maja Valles, Nanedi Valles, and Ares Vallis. Chryse Planitia may mark the location of a large lake or a bay along the coast of Mars’ possible ancient Northern Ocean. The smooth, flat plain of Chryse Planitia offered the potential for a safe landing site for the Viking 1 lander. At 2 to 3 km below the mean surface average, the low altitude of the region meant the lander’s parachute would have a greater opportunity to slow the lander as it descended.
