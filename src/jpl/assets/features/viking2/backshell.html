    Viking’s aeroshell provided protection for the lander during its entry into Mars’ atmosphere. The aeroshell consisted of two parts, the backshell and the heat shield. As it approached and entered the atmosphere, thrusters on the backshell controlled the attitude of the aeroshell. In addition to the frictional braking from the heat shield, the aeroshell’s angle of attack provided lift which helped slow the spacecraft’s descent. The backshell included instruments to study the upper atmosphere of Mars. At an altitude of 6,400 meters, a mortar in the backshell fired, deploying a parachute. The lander slowed and descended under the parachute to an altitude of 1,200 meters, at which time the lander separated from the backshell and parachute to make the final descent on its thrusters. Years later, the HiRISE camera aboard the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter was able to image the backshell a short distance to the northwest of the lander. The parachute may possibly be visible draped just to the southeast of the backshell.
