    The low plains of Utopia Planitia, along with those of Vastitas Borealis (landing site for the Phoenix lander), have been proposed as the location of an ancient Northern Ocean on Mars. Utopia Planitia itself lies within a giant impact basin approximately 3,200 km in diameter that was formed over 3.5 billion years ago. Over time, the basin floor was covered with volcanic and sedimentary deposits. Scalloped and polygonal patterned terrain in Utopia Planitia have been interpreted as indications of a layer of permafrost beneath the surface.
