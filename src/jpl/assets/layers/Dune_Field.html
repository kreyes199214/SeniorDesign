    The Mars Global Digital Dune Database presents a comprehensive and quantitative view of the geographic distribution of moderate- to large-size dune fields from 65Â° N to 65Â° S latitude and encompasses ~ 550 dune fields. The database will be expanded to cover the entire planet in later versions. Although an attempt was made to include all dune fields between 65Â° N and 65Â° S, some have likely been excluded for two reasons: 1) incomplete THEMIS IR (daytime) coverage may have caused exclusion of some moderate- to large-size dune fields or 2) resolution of THEMIS IR coverage (100m/pixel) certainly caused exclusion of smaller dune fields. The smallest dune fields in the database are ~ 1 km2 in area. While the moderate to large dune fields are likely to constitute the largest compilation of sediment on the planet, smaller stores of sediment of dunes are likely to be found elsewhere via higher resolution data. Thus, it should be noted that the database excludes all small dune fields and some moderate to large dune fields as well. Therefore the absence of mapped dune fields does not mean that such dune fields do not exist and is not intended to imply a lack of saltating sand in other areas.
