    Martian valley networks have long been viewed as some of the best evidence of prolonged surface water on Mars. They occur in nearly all geological settings including on crater walls, volcanoes, the sides of massifs, intercrater plains, and along the crustal dichotomy boundary. Given the ancient nature of these landscapes and the lack of many valleys on younger surfaces, most valleys are thought to have formed in the Noachian epoch (>âˆ¼3.7 Ga). It is now believed that the majority of valleys were formed by precipitation and surface runoff instead of groundwater processes. Studying the characteristics and timing of the valley networks provides important clues to the putative â€œwarm and wetâ€ early climate of Mars. The valleys were manually mapped using the determining characteristics of sublinear, erosional channels that form branching networks, slightly increasing in size downstream and dividing into smaller branches upslope. The primary bases for mapping were the Mars Global Surveyor THEMIS daytime IR mosaic and Mars Odyssey MOLA data, supplemented by the Mars Global Surveyor MOC mosaic and Viking Orbiter images. This updated global map of Martian valley networks using post-Viking data identifies more than eight times as many valleys and, on average doubles calculated drainage densities compared to previous Viking-based maps.
