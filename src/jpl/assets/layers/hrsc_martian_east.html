    This layer is a greyscale mosaic assembled using data from the High Resolution Stereo Camera aboard the European Space Agencyâ€™s Mars Express orbiter. HRSC is being used to obtain color and stereo images that will map 100% of Mars' surface at resolution better than 30 m/pixel, and 50% of the surface at better than 15 m/pixel. Each of the nine CCD lines of HRSC, a linescan imager (pushbroom camera), contains 5184 pixels. The channels consist of red, green, blue, near-infrared, three stereo channels (backward, nadir, and forward) and two photometric channels. The digital elevation model used for this layer is a combination of data derived from the HRSC and the Mars Orbiter Laser Altimeter.
