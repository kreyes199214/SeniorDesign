    This data was acquired using the Mars Orbiter Camera instrument aboard NASA’s Mars Global Surveyor spacecraft
    (MGS). MGS was launched on November 7, 1996 and arrived at Mars on September 11, 1997. It maintained a circular
    polar orbit, completing an orbital revolution every 117.65 minutes at an average altitude of 378 km (235 mi).
    Until November 2, 2006, MGS characterized and mapped Mars’ surface features, properties, topography, composition,
    and processes, as well as studied Mars’ weather and atmospheric structure.

    The Mars Orbiter Camera (MOC) consisted of 3 instruments. A black-and-white narrow angle camera captured high
    resolution images (typically 1.5 to 12 m per pixel) and red and blue wide angle cameras for context (240 m per pixel)
    and daily global imaging (7.5 km per pixel). This mosaic was assembled from Wide Angle red images (primarily those
    acquired in May-June 1999) from the Mars Orbiter Camera.
