    This data was acquired using the Thermal Emission Spectrometer instrument aboard NASA’s Mars Global Surveyor
    spacecraft (MGS). MGS was launched on November 7, 1996 and arrived at Mars on September 11, 1997. It maintained a
    circular polar orbit, completing an orbital revolution every 117.65 minutes at an average altitude of 378 km (235 mi).
    Until November 2, 2006, MGS characterized and mapped Mars’ surface features, properties, topography, composition,
    and processes, as well as studied Mars’ weather and atmospheric structure.

    The MGS Thermal Emission Spectrometer (TES) examined the surface and atmosphere of Mars. TES’s studies of surface
    features included characterizing the properties and composition of surface minerals, rocks, and ices using thermal
    infrared data from 6 to 50 micrometers (μm) and visible-NIR data from 0.3 to 2.9 μm. TES Albedo or reflectivity
    measurements such as those in this map were made using the visible-NIR detector and were useful in studying the
    nature of the surface materials and investigating changes in the upper surface due to moving sand and dust.
