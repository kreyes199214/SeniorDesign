    This data was acquired using the Thermal Emission Imaging System instrument aboard NASA’s Mars Odyssey spacecraft.
    Odyssey was launched on April 7, 2001 and arrived at Mars on October 24, 2001. It maintains a polar orbit around
    Mars with an altitude of about 3,800 km or 2,400 miles. Odyssey’s mission includes studying the mineralogy of Mars’
    surface (especially looking at minerals formed in the presence of water), detecting water and shallow buried ice,
    and studying the radiation environment.

    The Thermal Emission Imaging System (THEMIS) instrument is a camera system that gathers data in infrared and visible
    light. The infrared images sample nine different wavelengths allowing spectra to be constructed and compositions of
    imaged surfaces to be inferred. Daytime infrared Themis images typically emphasize topography, with warmer sunward
    slopes being brighter than cooler shaded slopes. Nighttime Themis images emphasize differences in thermal inertia
    between areas being observed, giving insights into the physical characteristics of the surfaces. This map is a
    THEMIS daytime infrared map.
