    Planetary nomenclature, like terrestrial nomenclature, is used to uniquely identify a feature on the surface of a
    planet or satellite so that the feature can be easily located, described, and discussed. The task of assigning
    official names to features has been taken up by the International Astronomical Union (IAU). The IAU defines
    naming themes for each planetary body. On Mars, albedo features have names from classical mythology assigned by
    Schiaparelli and Antoniadi. Large craters are named after deceased scientists, especially those who have contributed
    significantly to the study of Mars; and writers and others who have contributed to the lore of Mars. Small craters
    are named after small towns and villages of the world with populations of approximately 100,000 or less. Large valles
    (canyons) take their names for Mars/star in various languages (an exception is Valles Marineris, named for the
    Mariner 9 spacecraft that discovered it). Small valles names come from classical or modern names of rivers.
    Other features are named after nearby albedo features. The file of Martian nomenclature used here is maintained
    and provided by the IAU.
