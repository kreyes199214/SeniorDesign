    The Mission Points of Interest layer includes a variety of information relevant to the mission. It can include a 
    description of the landing site as well as spacecraft components that may be identified in the vicinity. In the 
    case of the Spirit, Opportunity, and Curiosity rovers, selected locations along their routes that are of particular 
    scientific interest or significant waypoints in their journeys may be included. Note that this is a representative
    list rather than an exhaustive list. For more details on the operations and findings of NASA's missions to Mars,
