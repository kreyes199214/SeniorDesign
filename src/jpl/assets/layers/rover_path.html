    This layer shows the rover's path across the surface of Mars. A common question is, "Without a GPS system on Mars,
    how can we precisely know our rovers' locations?" Several techniques are used. The HiRISE camera aboard NASA's
    orbiting Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter (MRO) spacecraft is able to image the rovers directly, pinpointing their
    locations with the camera's 30cm/pixel resolution. However MRO isn't able to image the rovers every sol (Martian day).
    Images from the rovers' onboard cameras are used to compare positions of landmarks as seen by the rovers to those
    recorded in images from orbit, and thus locate the rovers. Prior to the arrival of MRO in Mars orbit, this kind of
    landmark comparison was especially important, using the lower-resolution Mars Orbiter Camera aboard the Mars Global
    Surveyor. On a day to day basis, the positions and navigation of the rovers are determined largely by the images
    from the rovers themselves, typically returned on the previous sol. Finally, especially upon initial landing,
    locating the rover by Doppler shift and transit time of radio signals from the rovers is useful.
