"Aqueous minerals" are minerals that form in water, either by chemical alteration of pre-existing rock or by precipitation out of solution. Which minerals form depends on temperature, salinity, pH, and composition of the parent rock. Which aqueous minerals are present on Mars therefore provides important clues to understanding past environments. This layer displays distributions of silica (purple), phillosilicates (blue), sulfates (orange), chloride (yellow), and carbonates (green). Spectrometric observations were gathered from a variety of instruments including CRISM aboard Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter, OMEGA aboard Mars Express, and THEMIS aboard Mars Odyssey. B. L. Ehlmann, C.
