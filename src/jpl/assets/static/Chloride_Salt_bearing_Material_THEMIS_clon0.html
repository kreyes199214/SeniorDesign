This layer displays distribution of chloride salts as detected using the THEMIS instrument aboard Mars Odyssey. Formation of chloride salts via precipitation from evaporation in a basin could occur as the result of ponding of surface water runoff or groundwater upwelling. On Mars, deposition of chloride salts could also occur via hydrothermal brines where interaction of meteoric waters with heat from volcanism, impact events, or heated ash deposits (either volcanic or impact related). Degassing of volatile elements from magmas or lava flows under high-temperature, reducing conditions can produce halide salt dominated surface encrustations near fumaroles. Finally, chloride salts can form by efflorescence via atmospheric interactions, similar to the relatively thin late stage veneers and surface rinds found by the rover Opportunity in Meridiani Planum.
