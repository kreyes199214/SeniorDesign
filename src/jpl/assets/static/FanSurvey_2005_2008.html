Alluvial fans are discrete landforms created by the deposition of loose, water-transported material forming broad, gently sloping ramps radiating from mountainous drainage outlets emerging into low-relief basins. When water is available to these drainage basins, it commonly arrives in the form of intense cloudbursts or sudden snowmelt flash floods. This results in the rapid transport of coarse material, which comes to rest near the drainage outlet both because of the sudden reduction of stream power as it emerges from its confining outlet, and the ephemeral nature of the floods. Successive sheets and lobes of material transported in this manner build up over time to form a fan. Alluvial fans form subaerially. This distinguishes alluvial fans from fan deltas that form when a channel enters a standing body of water. They are also distinguished from debris flow fans. Debris flow fans form from gravity-driven, matrix (usually muddy) supported flow, as opposed to water driven flow transporting bed and suspended load.
