A number of glaciers on Mars appear to have experienced limited surface melting, leading to the formation of small glaciofluvial valleys. Some of these valleys show evidence for proglacial erosion (eroding the region immediately in front of or adjacent to a glacier), while others are supraglacial (eroding a glacierâ€™s surface). These valleys formed during the Amazonian, consistent with the inferred timing of glacial features based on both crater counts and stratigraphic constraints. This layer, based on a survey of images from the Context Camera (CTX) on the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter, shows the distribution of identified supraglacial and proglacial valleys.
