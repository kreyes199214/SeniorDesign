Martian glacier-like forms (GLFs) indicate that water ice has undergone deformation on the planet within its recent geological past, but the driving mechanisms behind the origin, evolution and dynamics of these landforms remain poorly understood. This layer depicts the distribution of GLFs, derived from a database of 8058 Context Camera (CTX) images. The inventory identifies 1309 GLFs (727 GLFs in the northern hemisphere and 582 in the southern hemisphere) clustered in the mid-latitudes (centred on a mean latitude of 39.3° in the north and −40.7° in the south) and in areas of rough topography.
