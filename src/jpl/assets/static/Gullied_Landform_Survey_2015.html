Gullies in the mid- and high-latitudes of Mars were first observed in Mars Global Surveyor (MGS) Mars Orbiter Camera (MOC) images in 1997. Appearing to be geologically young based on superposition relationships with aeolian features and the lack of impact craters observed on the majority of gullies, they quickly became a feature of interest for the Mars science community because of the implication of liquid water in their formation. This interpretation is based on the distinct morphological characteristics of gullies, including incised channels, many with banked and sinuous morphologies with terraces and streamlined features indicative of fluid flow. The possibility of liquid water on Mars in the geologically recent past—and possibly even today with the observation of present-day gully activity—is significant as it has implications for the past and present habitability of Mars. While the morphology of gully channels was initially interpreted as requiring liquid water for their formation, the difficulty in sustaining water on the surface in the recent martian climate led to the proposal of a number of models to explain the formation of gullies, including “dry” mass movement processes and CO2-related processes. This layer depicts the distribution of gullies on Mars based on >54,000 images from the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter (MRO) Context Camera (CTX) covering ∼85% of the martian surface at a resolution of ∼6 m/pixel.
