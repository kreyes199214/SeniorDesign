The surface of Mars has preserved the record of early environments in which its basaltic crust was altered by liquid water. These aqueous environments have survived in the form of hydrological morphologies and alteration minerals, including clays and hydrated salts. This layer displays results of a global-scale survey of the hydrous mineralogy of Mars based on near-infrared data from the CRISM imaging spectrometer aboard the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter and the OMEGA imaging spectrometer aboard Mars Express.
