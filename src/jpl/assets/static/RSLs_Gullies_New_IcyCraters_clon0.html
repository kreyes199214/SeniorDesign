Using remote sensing, mostly HiRISE, various teams conducted investigations for the distribution of fresh features including recurring slope lineae (RSL), fresh or new craters, icy craters and gullies.<br><br>
RSLs are low-albedo streaks observed to grow incrementally over the course of a martian year.  In the southern hemisphere, these features are primarily observed in the summer, while RSL are more active at equatorial latitudes.  This database includes lat/long points of regions where confirmed RSL have been observed in HiRISE images.  Because RSL are transient features, these points are only approximations of sites where RSL may be observed.  This database includes only confirmed RSL as listed in the referenced papers below.<br><br>
New/Fresh Craters - The depth/diameter ratio for new meter- to decameter-scale Martian craters formed in the last ~20 years averages 0.23, only slightly deeper than that expected for simple primary craters on rocky surfaces. Large variations in depth/diameter (d/D) between impact sites indicate that differences between the sites such as target material properties, impact velocity, angle, and physical state of the bolide(s) are important in determining the depth of small craters in the strength regime.<br><br>
Icy Craters - Twenty small new impact craters or clusters have been observed to excavate bright material inferred to be ice at mid-latitudes and high latitudes on Mars. In the northern hemisphere, the craters are widely distributed geographically and occur at latitudes as low as 39°N. Stability modeling suggests that this ice distribution requires a long-term average atmospheric water vapor content around 25 precipitable micrometers, more than double the present value, which is consistent with the expected effect of recent orbital variations.<br><br>
Gullies - Gully landforms are commonly taken as evidence for surface liquid water in the recent geological history of Mars. Repeat observations with the High Resolution Imaging Science Experiment (HiRISE) instrument on the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter demonstrate widespread activity in gullies in the southern hemisphere, particularly in those with the freshest morphologies. This activity includes substantial channel incision and large-scale mass movements, and constitutes ongoing gully formation rather than degradation of older landforms. New apron deposits that are bright, dark and neutrally toned have all been observed. The timing of gully activity is seasonally controlled and occurs during the period when seasonal frost is present and defrosting. These observations support a model in which currently active gully formation is driven mainly by seasonal CO2 frost. Gullies in the northern hemisphere are far less active than those in the south.<br><br>
