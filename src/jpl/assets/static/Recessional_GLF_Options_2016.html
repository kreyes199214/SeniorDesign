Marsâ€™ mid-latitude glacier-like forms (GLFs) have undergone substantial mass loss and recession since a hypothesised last martian glacial maximum (LMGM) stand. Recessional GLFs may represent important archives of recent climatic change on Mars This layer depicts the distribution of recessional GLFs, derived from analysis of 1293 GLFs3 identified within Context Camera (CTX) imagery. A total of 436 GLFs were identified showing strong evidence of recession: 197 in the northern hemisphere and 239 in the southern hemisphere. S. Brough, B Hubbard, and A.
