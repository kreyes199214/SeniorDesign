NASA's first Landing Site/Exploration Zone Workshop for Human Missions to the Surface of Mars was held Oct. 27-30, 2015 at the Lunar and Planetary Institute in Houston. The conference started the process for choosing sites on Mars that NASA's Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter and Mars Odyssey spacecraft along with any future missions over the coming decades could then further image to create better maps and provide valuable scientific data of these potential Exploration Zones. Over 40 Exploration Zones were proposed at the meeting. The proposals included defining the 100-km radius circle defining the boundary of the zones, science and resource regions of interest within the zones, landing and habitat sites, and justifications across a wide range of science and engineering criteria. This layer was prepared by the NASA's Evolvable Mars Campaign (EMC) showing the distribution of the proposed Exploration Zones with their bounding circles and regions of interest.
