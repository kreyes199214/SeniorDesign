The third landing site workshop for the 2020 Mars Rover mission was held in Monrovia, CA, on February 8-10, 2017. The primary goal of the third workshop was to further evaluate the eight candidate landing sites that emerged from the second workshop and reduce the number of candidate sites remaining under consideration to three or four. The eight sites under consideration from the second workshop were Columbia Hills/Gusev, Eberswalde, Holden, Jezero, Mawrth, NE Syrtis, Nili Fossae, and SW Melas. After the third landing site workshop, this list was narrowed down to Columbia Hills/Gusev, Jezero, and NE Syrtis
