    Moon Trek is a major new release that significantly upgrades and builds upon the capabilities of its predecessor,
    NASA’s Lunar Mapping and Modeling Portal (LMMP). The new Trek interface provides greatly improved navigation, 3D
    visualization, fly-overs, performance, and reliability. Use of the Trek interface also provides compatibility with
    the other portals developed by NASA’s Lunar and Planetary Mapping and Modeling Project.

    Building on a heritage of supporting site selection and analysis for the Constellation program, Moon Trek has
    been developed to meet the needs of mission planners in a new era of lunar exploration. The portal integrates a
    suite of interactive tools that incorporate observations from past and current lunar missions, creating a
    comprehensive lunar research Web portal. The online Web portal allows anyone with access to a computer to search
    through and view a vast number of lunar images and other digital products.

    Moon Trek provides easy-to-use tools for browsing, data layering and feature search, including detailed
    information on the source of each assembled data product. Using Moon Trek, many hundreds of lunar data products can
    be visualized, stacked, blended, and downloaded. Detailed metadata for each data product is also made available
    to the user. While emphasizing mission planning, Moon Trek also addresses the lunar science community, the lunar
    commercial community, education and public outreach (E/PO), and anyone else interested in accessing or utilizing
    lunar data. Its analysis tools allow users to perform a wide range of analyses such as measuring distances, creating
    elevation plots, and conducting lighting and slope analysis. Users can also draw bounding boxes around any areas of
    interest to generate output files for 3D printing of desired surface features.
